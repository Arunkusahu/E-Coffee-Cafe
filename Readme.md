Starting with a detailed UI design in Adobe XD, I transformed the vision into a vibrant, user-friendly frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project focused on creating an attractive and immersive experience, highlighting the café's charm with enhanced colors and smooth transitions. From design to deployment, every step was taken with precision to ensure the best user experience.
